Description: apply set operations like intersection to text inputs
 setop is a simple console utility for handling multiple inputs from files or
 other streams as mathematical sets. That is you can apply typical set
 operations like union, intersection, or set difference and print a resulting
 set (sorted and with unique string elements) to standard output or you can give
 answer to special queries like number of elements.
 .
 Besides the default line-based parsing there are several options for choosing
 input sets and identifying set elements, and there are also several options for
 the type of output, e. g. it is possible to check for set equality or to check
 if one set is a subset of another.
